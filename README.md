# To-do-list
"To-Do List" application is a common project that can be implemented in various programming languages and can be completed in a short time.
A brief overview of how to approach this project:
- Design the User Interface: Create a basic user interface that allows users to view their to-do list, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
- Implement Task Management: Set up the logic to manage tasks. This includes adding new tasks, storing them in memory or a database, retrieving tasks, updating task status, and deleting tasks.
- Handle User Actions: Implement event handlers or callbacks for user actions such as clicking buttons to add, mark, or delete tasks. These functions should interact with the task management logic to perform the desired actions.
- Display the Task List: Ensure that the user interface reflects the current state of the task list. Update the display whenever a task is added, marked as completed, or deleted.
- Polish and Test: Make any necessary improvements to the user interface and functionality. Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

The Goal: main goal is to have a hands-on learning experience and apply the core concepts of programming, user interface design, and data management.
